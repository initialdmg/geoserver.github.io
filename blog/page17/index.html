<h2 id="release-candidatetesting">Release Candidate Testing</h2>

<p>The 2.11 release is expected in March, this release candidate is a “dry run” where we confirm new functionality is working as expected and double check the packaging and release process.</p>

<p>Please note that GeoServer 2.9 has reached its end-0f-life. If your organization has not yet upgraded please give us hand by evaluating 2.11-RC1 and providing feedback and your experiences for the development team. This is a win/win situation where your participation can both assist the GeoServer team and reduce your risk when upgrading.</p>

<h3 id="corrected-default-anchorpoint-for-labelplacement">Corrected default AnchorPoint for LabelPlacement</h3>

<p>An <a href="https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOT-5632">issue with SLD 1.0 rendering</a> has been fixed - when a LabelPlacement did not include a AnchorPoint we were using the wrong default!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>BEFORE: default anchor point was X=0.5 and Y=0.5 - which is at the middle height and middle length of the label text.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AFTER: default anchor point was X=0.0 and Y=0.5 - which is at the middle height of the lefthand
side of the label text.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This is a long standing issue that was only just noticed in February. If you need to “restore” the incorrect behaviour please startup with -D_org.geotools.renderer.style.legacyAnchorPoint=true _system property.</p>

<h3 id="startup-performance">Startup Performance</h3>

<p>With <a href="https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/wiki/GSIP%20155">extensive improvement</a>s to startup performance and OGC requests for large installations we are looking forward to feedback from your experience testing.</p>

      <p class="post-meta">Mar 9, 2017 • jgarnett</p>
    </header>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p>In our previous blog post we highlighted the <a href="http://blog.geoserver.org/2017/01/23/geoserver-code-sprint-2017/">GeoServer Code Sprint 2017</a> taking place at the of this month. We are all looking forward to GeoSolutions <a href="http://www.geo-solutions.it/blog/geoserver-code-sprint-2017/">hosting us in beautiful Tuscany</a> and have lots of work to do.</p>

<p>One of the secrets (and this comes as no surprise) to having a successful code sprint is being prepared. With this year’s REST API migration from restlet to spring model-view-controller we want to have all technical decisions made, and examples for the developers to work from, prior to any boots hitting the ground in Italy.</p>

<p>But before we get into the details …</p>

<h2 id="code-sprint-sponsors">Code Sprint Sponsors</h2>

<p>We would like to thank our sprint sponsors - we are honoured that so many organizations have stepped up world wide to fund this activity.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gaia3d.com/en/">Gaia3D</a> is a professional software company in the field of geospatial information and Earth science technology. We would like to thank Gaia3D for their gold sponsorship.</p>

<p><img src="/img/uploads/Gaia3d-300x112.png" alt="Gaia3d" /></p>

<p><a href="http://iag.com.au/">Insurance Australia Group</a> (IAG) is our second gold sponsor. This is a great example of open source being used, and supported, by an engineering team. Thanks to Hugh Saalmans and the Location Engineering team at IAG for your support.</p>

<p><a href="/img/uploads/iag_logo.png"><img src="/img/uploads/iag_logo-300x300.png" alt="iag_logo" /></a></p>

<h2 id="getting-ready-for-rest">Getting Ready for REST</h2>

<p>In this week’s GeoServer meeting we had a chance to sit down and plan out the steps needed to get ready.</p>

<p>The majority of prep will go into performing the restlet to spring mvc migration for a sample REST API end point to produce a “code example” for developers to follow. We have selected the rest/styles endpoint as one of the easier examples:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Preflight check:</strong> Before we start we want to have a good baseline of the current REST API responses. We would like to double check that each endpoint has a JUnit test case that checks the response against a reference file. Most of our tests just count the number of elements, or drill into the content to look for a specific value. <em>The goal is to use these reference files as a quick “regression test” when performing the migration.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Migrate rest/styles from StyleResource (restlet) to StyleController (spring):</strong> This should be a bit of fun, part of why spring model-view-controller was selected. Our goal is to have one Controller per end-point, and configure the controller using annotations directly in the Java file. This ends up being quite readable with variable names being taken directly out of the URL path. It is also easier to follow since you do not have to keep switching between XML and Java files to figure out what is going on.  <em>It is important that the example is “picture perfect” as it will be used as a template by the developers over the course of the sprint, and will be an example of the level of quality we expect during the activity.
<a href="/img/uploads/code-example.png"><img src="/img/uploads/code-example.png" alt="code-example" /></a></em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Create StyleInfo bindings (using XStream for xml and json generation):</strong> The above method returns a StyleInfo data structure, our current restlet solutions publishes each “resource” using the XStream library. We think we can adapt our XStream work for use in spring model-view-controller by configuring a binding for StyleInfo and implementing in using XStream.  _This approach is the key reason we are confident in this migration being a success; existing clients that depend on exactly the same output from GeoServer - should get exactly the same output.
_</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>StyleController path management:</strong> There is some work to configure each controller, while we have the option of doing some custom logic inside each controller we would like to keep this to a minimum.  _This step is the small bit of applicationContext.xml configuration work we need to do for each controller, we expect it to be less work then reslet given the use of annotations.
_</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reference Documentation Generation:</strong> We are looking into a tool called swagger for documentation generation. Our current reference documentation only lists each end-point (and does not provide information on the request and response expected - leaving users to read the examples or try out the api in an ad-hoc fashion). <em>See screen snap below, our initial experience is positive, but the amount of work required is intimidating.</em>
<a href="/img/uploads/swagger-editor.png"><img src="/img/uploads/swagger-editor.png" alt="swagger-editor" /> </a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Updated examples for cURL and Python:</strong> We would like to rewrite our examples in a more orderly fashion to make sure both XML and JSON sample requests and responses are provided. <em>Ideally we will inline the “reference files” from the JUnit regression test in step 1 to ensure that the documentation is both accurate and up to date.</em></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You can see a pretty even split in our priorities between performing the migration, and updating the documentation. We believe both of these goals need to be met for success.</p>

<h2 id="next-stop-tuscany">Next stop Tuscany</h2>

<p>Although this blog post focuses on the sponsorship/planning/logistics side of setting up a code sprint there is one group without whom this event could not happen - our sprint participants and in-kind sponsors (providing a venue &amp; staff).</p>

      <p class="post-meta">Mar 2, 2017 • fsquadro</p>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p>This is a special year because the <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/geoserver/info">Geoserver Brazilian Community</a> celebrates 10 years. It all started in 2007 with an <a href="http://blog.geoserver.org/2007/05/23/geoserver-in-brazil/">GeoServer’ Course at III ENUM</a> (event focused on MapServer) in Brasilia, federal capital, and since then the community has approximately 600 members and more than 5,000 messages exchanged during those 10 years.</p>

<p>During this time, GeoServer has been widely disseminated both in education, government and corporate. There are reports that large banking institutions, telecommunications and information technology companies in addition to governmental sectors such as IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics), Embrapa (Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation), IBAMA (Brazilian Institute of Environment and Natural Resources Renewables), among others, has used GeoServer in its various projects.</p>

<p><a href="/img/uploads/brasil.jpg"><img src="/img/uploads/brasil-300x240.jpg" alt="brasil" /></a></p>

<p>However, the most notable among his many successes was the establishment of <a href="http://blog.geoserver.org/2012/05/16/parabens/">GeoServer as the official map server</a> of INDE (Spatial Data Infrastructure), in 2008 by then President Lula.</p>

<p>We would like to thank everyone who has contributed to the growth of GeoServer in Brazil, whether writing articles, giving lectures or simply encouraging the use of GeoServer within its institutions. A special thanks to Andrea Aime who implemented the <a href="http://geotoolsnews.blogspot.it/2010/01/polyconic.html">projection used by Brazil</a>.</p>

<p>This is a beta release of GeoServer made in conjunction with GeoTools 16-beta.</p>

<p>We want to encourage people to test the release thoughly and report back any issue found. With no further delay, let’s see what’s new, that is, what is there to test!</p>

<h2 id="ysld-module-graduatedto-supported-land">YSLD module graduated to supported land</h2>

<p>The YSLD styling language has been graduated to supported land, becoming an official extension. YSLD is a YAML based language which closely matches the stucture of SLD, and the internal data model that GeoServer’s renderer uses. Here is an example from the YSLD Cook Book:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'YSLD&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;Cook&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;Book:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;Simple&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;Line'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;feature-styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;rules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;symbolizers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;stroke-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'#000000'&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;stroke-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Compared to SLD it sports a similar structure, but in a more compact and readable syntax. Here the same example can be expressed in a more compact format:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;  stroke-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'#000000'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;  stroke-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Similarly to SLD and CSS, the user guide contains both a <a href="http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/styling/ysld/reference/index.html">reference</a> and a <a href="http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/styling/ysld/cookbook/index.html">cookbook</a> to get you started. There is also a <a href="http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/styling/workshop/index.html">styling workshop</a> with both CSS and YSLD examples (including an important example for <a href="http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/styling/workshop/ysld/done.html#converting-to-ysld">converting your SLD styles to YSLD</a>).</p>

<h2 id="vector-tiles-graduate-to-extension">Vector tiles graduate to extension</h2>

<p>The vector tiles community module graduated to extension. The module allows to generate vector tiles out of WMS and WMTS requests, using SLD to filter the contents of the tile at the requested scale. Supported vector tiles formats are MVT (MapBox Vector Tile), GeoJSON vector tiles, and TopoJSON vector tiles.</p>

<p>This allow for much more compact data transfers, reduced tile caches thanks to overzooming support, and allows the client to control styling. Here is an example of the client rendering a world map as a vector tile, and highlighting a specific area by attribute:</p>

<p><a href="/img/uploads/vectortileoutputafrica.png"><img src="/img/uploads/vectortileoutputafrica.png" alt="vectortileoutputafrica" /></a></p>

<p>Hop on the <a href="http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/extensions/vectortiles/index.html">documentation to get more information </a>about this extension, along with a couple of presentations highlighting vector tile usage.</p>

<h2 id="underlying-labels-in-sld">Underlying labels in SLD</h2>

<p>A new vendor option allow to underline labels in SLD (and CSS). Just add:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;VendorOption name="underlineText"&gt;true&lt;/VendorOption&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="/img/uploads/Selezione_197.png"><img src="/img/uploads/Selezione_197.png" alt="Selezione_197" /></a></p>

<h2 id="opaque-container-layer-group-mode">Opaque Container Layer Group Mode</h2>

<p>A new layer group mode has been added, called “Opaque Container”. It’s similar to “single” in that you cannot see the layers contained in it, but it also prevents its layers from showing up at the root level of the capabilities document. This new mode is targeted to building “base maps” that the client is not allowed to take apart into their components.</p>

<p>You can read more about layer <a href="http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/data/webadmin/layergroups.html#layer-group-modes">group modes in the GeoServer user guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="layer-group-security">Layer Group Security</h2>

<p>The build-in data security can now <a href="http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/security/layer.html#">secure layer groups too</a>, for both global and workspace specific groups. “Tree” mode groups (named tree, container tree, opaque container) will extend the security rules applied to them to the layers contained.</p>

<p><a href="/img/uploads/Selezione_196.png"><img src="/img/uploads/Selezione_196.png" alt="Selezione_196" /></a></p>

<h2 id="improved-loading-and-ogc-request-times-for-large-installations">Improved loading and OGC request times for large installations</h2>

<p>GeoServer has historically had issues with long startup times on installation having several thousands layers. A group of recent improvements significantly sped up these times making it possible to handle tends of thousands of layers with no particular headaches.</p>

<p>For reference, some tests were run on a Core i7 860, 16GB of memory, 2TB hybrid drive (spinning disk plus SSD cache), on two different data directories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“Many states”: 1 workspace, 1 store, 10k layers, 10k cached layers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Large”: 1001 workspaces, 11000 stores (a mix of shapefiles, postgis, directory of shapefile, single tiff, arcgrid, mosaics), 42000 layers and 42000 associated tile layers</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Startup times have been measured in both “cold” and “warm” mode, “cold” means the operating system file system cache contains none of the configuration files and the startup has to actually read everything from the disk, “warm” means the data dir is fully cached in memory instead:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Many states, cold startup: 30s</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many states, warm startup: 21s</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Large, cold startup: 107s</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Large, warm startup: 45s</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, worst case is loading in excess of 40 thousands layers in less than a minute and a half!</p>

<p>For reference, “Large” startup times with JDBCConfig are 290s for cold startup, and 120s for warm startup. This is mostly due to cached layers loading, if your configuration has none the startup time will be of around 20-30 seconds instead (no matter how many layers are configured, because JDBCConfig loads layers on a as-needed basis at runtime… for a cost, see below).</p>

<p>It is also interesting to compare the times needed to run a GetMap against one of the “topp:states” in the “many states” data directory.</p>

<h2 id="improved-lookup-of-epsg-codes">Improved lookup of EPSG codes</h2>

<p>Ever been annoyed by some shapefile with a <strong>.prj</strong> declaration that GeoServer does not understand? If so, try this new release, we pulled some extra heuristics and smarts to figure out the equivalent EPSG code of thousands more cases. This will hopefully reduce guesswork when configuring new vector layers, not to mention significantly speeding up importing large directories of shapefiles in the “Importer” extension.</p>

<h2 id="other-assorted-improvements">Other assorted improvements</h2>

<p>There are many improvements to look at in the <a href="https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10000&amp;version=14404">release notes</a>, cherry picking a few here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>New REST call allowing a users to modify his/her password (no UI for it yet, sorry)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Support JSON encoded exceptions for WFS 2.0 too (was already available for 1.0 and 1.1)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Drastically reduced output size for WMS PDF output format, when using a graphic fill based on repeated marks or SVG symbols</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improved scalability when using “advanced projection handling” thanks to a new implementation of SoftValueHashMap (used as a cache by the referencing subsystem)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Better transparency handling of NODATA and ROI (Region Of Interest)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixes in computation of global disk quota (if you find you have a negative number, upgrade, wipe out the quota database, and restart)</p>
  </li>
</ul>
